The instructions and word lists were created by Electric Literature:

* [This Handy Chart Automatically Generates a Pitch for Your New Novel](https://electricliterature.com/how-to-write-elevator-pitch-novel-publicity-infographic-a8ec74ecf7ce)

I only wrote the JavaScript to make it amusingly easy and interactive.

## This is not a real app

This is literally just JS and HTML. If you want a few minutes of amusement in your local browser, download the files into a directory on your computer, open the HTML file, and follow the instructions.

## This was written in a few hours

I did some bug-fixing and refactoring, so it covers common corner cases and doesn't have absurd amounts of code duplication, but I didn't bother to do anything about nicely reading in data or generalizing to more than two sentences. PRs are accepted if you feel the desire to improve. Or just fork it and make it better.
